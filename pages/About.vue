          Hi, my name is Steve Holmes and I'm a creative front end developer
          living in Marple, Stockport. I love problem solving, coding, learning
          new skills, hiking, cycling and playing the guitar. I built this
          portfolio site to try out a few new things, and build upon my knowedge
          of Vue.js. I'm always keen to maintain best practices and discover new
          ways to write re-useable, DRY code.
        </p>
        <p>
          I currently work as a front-end developer on the .NET team at CTI
          Digital, in Manchester.
